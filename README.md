Amazing Prime needs a datasets from Wikipedia and Kaggle extracted, transformed and loaded into SQL. These datasets were initially required for a company sponsored hackathon. 
Amazing Prime was very impressed by the datasets provided that they requested a permanent, automated pipeline that is able to take in new data, transform and load new data into existing tables on a regular basis. 
This project encompasses the work that went in to creating this database.
